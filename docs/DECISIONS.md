# Decisions

Record choices, their reasons, rejected alternatives and conditions for revisiting them. The
older entries remain preserved at `new:docs/DECISIONS.md`; do not rewrite that archived history.

## D-012 · 2026-10-17 · ChromeClaw lives fully in the terminal

- Decision: the TUI is ChromeClaw's complete frontend. Keep one-shot CLI and JSON/JSONL modes.
  Chrome is the browser work surface, with a minimal integration bridge only if a measured gap
  requires it. This supersedes archived D-001's MV3 side-panel product direction and the earlier
  unimplemented extension delivery plan, under Kanishk's explicit instruction.
- Why: build on runnable main and keep requests, model setup, approvals, progress and traces in
  the terminal. Support BYOK hosted and local models through the same task and safety contracts.
- Design: borrow the master at `../design-kit` and preserved `new:design/` identity, theme and TUI
  rules. Adapt presentation to the current TypeScript application; no Rust rewrite is implied.
- Safety: retain the intent of the old protections, upgrade failing mechanisms and map replacements
  to regression evidence. Model locality never bypasses a gate.
- Engineering: follow the archived engineering contract's applicable code/comment/commit rules.
  Prefer five readable lines over fifty when behavior and safety are equivalent. Add abstractions
  and dependencies only for demonstrated complexity, with focused commits and verification gaps.
- Rejected: a side-panel frontend, two autonomous runtimes, a framework transplant and a language
  rewrite solely to use the kit's Rust terminal helper.
- Revisit when: Kanishk changes the product direction, or a measured browser limitation requires
  a narrowly scoped integration decision. It does not authorize a second frontend by default.
- Status: product direction adopted; implementation and compatibility remain pending in the plans.
